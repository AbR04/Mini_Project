# Advanced Class Model Explanation

Here’s an expanded **textual explanation** of the advanced class model, with each requested element explicitly highlighted:

---

### **1. Classes with Attributes and Methods**

#### **Class: DatasetHandler**
This class manages all operations related to loading and splitting datasets.  
- **Attributes**:
  - `data_path`: The file path where the dataset resides.
  - `labels`: A list of string labels corresponding to classes (e.g., "Pneumonia", "Normal").
  - `img_size`: Specifies the size to which all images will be resized (e.g., 224x224).
- **Methods**:
  - `load_data()`: Loads the dataset from the given file path.
  - `split_data()`: Splits the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets and returns them.
- **Associations**:
  - Aggregates `DataPreprocessor` to handle preprocessing operations.
  - Connected to `Trainer` via a 1 ↔ 3 multiplicity, as it provides three datasets (train, validation, test) to the Trainer.

---

#### **Class: DataPreprocessor**
This class prepares data for the model by applying various preprocessing techniques.  
- **Attributes**:
  - `augmentations`: A list of augmentations applied to the dataset (e.g., flip, rotate).
  - `normalize_factor`: The factor used to normalize pixel intensity values.
- **Methods**:
  - `resize(image, size)`: Resizes an image to the specified dimensions.
  - `normalize(image)`: Normalizes pixel values using the normalization factor.
  - `augment(image)`: Applies augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, zooming).
- **Associations**:
  - Aggregates data into `DatasetHandler`.
  - Participates in an n-ary association with `DatasetHandler` and `ModelBuilder`.

---

#### **Class: ModelBuilder**
This class handles model creation and manipulation.  
- **Attributes**:
  - `layers`: A list of strings specifying the type of layers (e.g., "Conv2D", "Dense").
  - `output_classes`: The number of classes the model will predict.
- **Methods**:
  - `build_model()`: Constructs and returns a machine learning model.
  - `save_model(filepath)`: Saves the model to the specified file.
  - `load_model(filepath)`: Loads a model from the specified file.
- **Generalization**:
  - It has two derived classes:  
    - **ConvolutionalModel**: Specializes in CNN layers for feature extraction.
    - **FullyConnectedModel**: Specializes in fully connected dense layers.

---

#### **Class: Trainer**
The Trainer class is responsible for training and validating the model.  
- **Attributes**:
  - `loss_function`: The loss function used to compute model errors.
  - `optimizer`: The optimization algorithm used during training (e.g., SGD, Adam).
  - `epochs`: The number of iterations the training will run.
  - `batch_size`: The size of data batches.
- **Methods**:
  - `train(data)`: Trains the model on the given training dataset.
  - `validate(data)`: Evaluates the model on the validation dataset and returns performance metrics.
- **Associations**:
  - Aggregates `ModelBuilder`, as Trainer uses the model for training.

---

#### **Class: Evaluator**
This class handles evaluation tasks post-training.  
- **Attributes**:
  - `metrics`: A dictionary to store evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision).
  - `confusion_matrix`: A matrix showing true vs. predicted class distributions.
- **Methods**:
  - `evaluate(test_data)`: Evaluates the model on the test dataset and calculates metrics.
  - `generate_report()`: Generates a summary report of the evaluation results.

---

#### **Class: Predictor**
This class performs predictions using the trained model.  
- **Attributes**:
  - `trained_model`: The trained model used for predictions.
- **Methods**:
  - `predict(image)`: Predicts the label of a single image.
  - `batch_predict(images)`: Predicts labels for a batch of images.

---

#### **Class: Visualizer**
This class manages visual outputs like graphs and prediction visualization.  
- **Attributes**:
  - `plots`: A list of plots created during the training/evaluation process.
- **Methods**:
  - `plot_metrics(history)`: Visualizes metrics such as loss or accuracy over epochs.
  - `show_predictions(images, labels)`: Displays a set of images with their predicted and actual labels.
- **Composition**:
  - Composes `Evaluator`, as it depends on evaluation results for its functionality.

---

### **2. Enumeration**
- **Enum: AugmentationType**  
  Used to standardize augmentation types in the `DataPreprocessor`.  
  - Values:
    - `ROTATION`
    - `ZOOM`
    - `FLIP`
    - `SHIFT`

---

### **3. Generalization**
- **Base Class**: ModelBuilder  
  - Derived classes:  
    - `ConvolutionalModel`: Adds methods and attributes specific to CNN architecture.
    - `FullyConnectedModel`: Adds methods and attributes specific to dense-layer-based models.

---

### **4. Aggregation and Composition**
- **Aggregation**:
  - `Trainer` aggregates `ModelBuilder`.
  - `DatasetHandler` aggregates `DataPreprocessor`.
- **Composition**:
  - `Visualizer` composes `Evaluator` (Visualizer is tightly coupled with Evaluator).

---

### **5. Overlapping and Incomplete Inheritance**
- **Overlapping**:
  - `DatasetHandler` can interact with both `DataPreprocessor` and `Trainer` independently.
- **Incomplete**:
  - `ModelBuilder` is abstract, requiring implementation in `ConvolutionalModel` or `FullyConnectedModel`.

---

### **6. Multiplicity**
- **Trainer ↔ DatasetHandler**: 1 ↔ 3  
  A Trainer instance uses three datasets: training, validation, and testing.  
- **DatasetHandler ↔ DataPreprocessor**: 1 ↔ 1  
  Each DatasetHandler uses exactly one DataPreprocessor.

---

### **7. N-ary Association**
- **DatasetHandler ↔ DataPreprocessor ↔ ModelBuilder**:  
  This association defines how preprocessed data from `DataPreprocessor` is used by the `ModelBuilder` for training.  
  - Attributes:
    - `preprocessed_data_count`: The number of preprocessed datasets passed to the ModelBuilder.

---

### **8. Association End Names**
- **Trainer ↔ ModelBuilder**:
  - End name at Trainer: *uses*
  - End name at ModelBuilder: *built by*

---

### Additional Notes
1. This class diagram strikes a balance between clarity and complexity, showcasing relationships through aggregation, composition, and n-ary associations.
2. Inheritance (generalization) and enumerations are used to add modularity and flexibility.
3. The inclusion of multiplicity, association end names, and overlapping/incomplete relationships demonstrates an advanced understanding of class design.
